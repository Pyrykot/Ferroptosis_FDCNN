This project contains source codes, annotatation files and images for publication "Cells with morphological features associated with ferroptosis can be detected with a deep convolutional neural network in DLBCL cell lines". 

This project can be used as a starting point for other similar object detection tasks. However it is purpose made for our special usecase and a lot of the codebase is hardcoded for our special purpose. 
Training file contains neccessary code to initiate model training. Config file contains parameters and neccessary file paths. Inference module is used to use the model trained previously to infere new files. Outputs folder is not present in the git structure and that must be added before using the code. 
Trained model, geojson outputs and xlsx files are stored in the outputs folder.
